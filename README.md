## Getting Started

Welcome to the workshop N° 2 abstraction, interface and polymorphism

These are the task that I completed:

[SpaceShip classification article](https://moaramore.com/2016/05/14/clasificacion-de-las-naves-espaciales)

1. Retrieve interfaces and generic abstract attributes that you can take from the article, create interfaces and abstract classes you may think be correct about the article.
2. create at least two abstract methods for one spaceship
3. create at least four types of a spaceship with different methods, if it´s possible to make one overload and override method.
4. Make one main class to allow you to create the spaceships under the boolean condition or if-else or switch-case statement
5. The program must be run indefinitely until the user decides to stop the program.
6. the workshop must be delivery to the next [Link](https://forms.gle/RvYhVpPptLyogWyT7)

## Structure

#### abstract classes
    * SpaceShip
    * ShuttleVehicle -- has the two abstract methods required in 2.
    * UnmannedShip
    * MannedShip

#### Interfaces
    * IshuttleShip
    * IunmannedShip
    * ImannedShip

#### Extra spaceShips
    * ApoloII
    * DragonXX
    * SaturnXIII
    * VikingV

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `Workshop_abstract_interface/src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `Workshop_abstract_interface/lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
